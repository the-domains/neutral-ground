# ChargeUp

Many social services and job opportunities require phone or internet access to apply. While the city has prioritized free wifi, it lacks public electrical outlets.

We partner with resource centers to provide the street community with portable phone chargers.

For more information, or to get involved, please email [info@neutralground.com][0]
